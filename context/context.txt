                        UofTHacks 2026 - Shopify Track
                    Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) Project
================================================================================

SLOGAN: "Speak it. Cart it. Own it."

================================================================================
PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================
Finding products I want to buy takes too much effort:
- Look at shipping
- Ethical issues
- Personal preferences
- Sorting through tons of stores and products

================================================================================
THE IDEA
================================================================================
We use UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol) to find potential products that the 
user wants. "Hey I want to buy shoes" → the agent looks through UCP for items 
that best match the user query → the agent can fully buy and checkout the product.

================================================================================
USER FLOW
================================================================================
1. User lands on website → Chat Page
2. User types query into chat bar (e.g., "I want to buy shoes")
3. Query sent to backend
4. Agent queries merchant MCP for products
5. Agent returns results through the endpoint
6. Display 3-5 products with: price, name, image, store, delivery time, checkbox
7. User clicks/checks items to "add to cart"
8. User can refine search via floating chat in bottom right corner
9. Recommendations section shows "Frequently Bought Together" items
10. This happens iteratively until user clicks "Checkout"
11. Cart visualized with price and items (user can remove items)
12. User authorizes payment

Offshoots: If users are not happy, they can prompt more or generate more items

[x] Define problem, scope, and pitch
[x] Decide tech stack
[x] Design system architecture
[ ] Data schema for frontend, backend, UCP
[ ] Get feedback on the idea from a judge, if possible

================================================================================

[ ] Filters: price tags, color, etc.
[ ] Smart ranking: show products that best match query/prompt
[ ] ElevenLabs API for voice interaction
[ ] How it Works page with tutorial
