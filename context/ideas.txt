Other idea for feature related to teh user login in so it can have more personallized results
1. The "Fit" Profile (Crucial for Apparel)
Target Problem: "Returns are annoying" & "Sorting through products"

Clothing Sizes: Ask for standard sizes (S/M/L) but also numeric (Waist 32, Shoe 10.5).

Fit Preference: "Do you like Oversized, Regular, or Slim fit?" (This helps the agent filter out products that don't match their style).

Gender Identity/Presentation: To filter the initial catalog queries effectively.

2. The "Ethical & Values" Filter
Target Problem: "Ethical issues"

Sustainability Score: A slider from "I just want cheap" to "Eco-friendly is non-negotiable."

Deal Breakers: Checkboxes for specific constraints:

Vegan / Cruelty-Free

Made in [Your Country]

Carbon Neutral Shipping

Black/Minority-Owned Businesses

3. The "Vibe Check" (AI Powered)
Target Problem: "Personal preferences"

Style Archetypes: Instead of boring text, show them 4 AI-generated images of different styles (e.g., "Streetwear", "Old Money", "Gorpcore", "Minimalist") and ask: "Which one is you?"

Brand Affinity: "Which brands do you currently love?" (e.g., Nike, Reformation, Uniqlo). The agent can use this to find "Shopify equivalents" of big brands.

4. Logistics & Budget
Target Problem: "Look at shipping" & "Budget"

Zip Code / Region: Essential for calculating accurate shipping times and costs immediately (so the "Add to Cart" price is real).

Price Sensitivity: "On a Friday night, are you ordering...?"

McDonalds (Budget-conscious)

Uber Eats (Mid-range)

Fancy Steakhouse (Luxury)

Translate this to a hidden weight in your ranking algorithm.

5. Fun Hackathon "Moonshot" Ideas
If you want to impress the judges with the Gemini API:

"Upload Your Look": Let them upload a selfie or a picture of their closet during signup. Use Gemini Vision to analyze their color palette and style automatically.

"Voice Intro": Since your slogan is "Speak it," let them record a 10-second intro: "Hi, I'm Justin, I like techwear and I hate waiting for shipping." Analyze the text-to-speech for keywords.
